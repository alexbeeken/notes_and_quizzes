- q: I went to the doctor at 29,
  a: I said, doc I need something to make me feel right
- q: I’m sitting on the couch from 6 to 9
  a: and up late at night watching 2011’s In Time
- q: so she looked up and into my soul
  a: said I think you need this drug called lexapro
- q: I threw up my hands, I was like “aw hell fucking no”
  a: “the governments trying to drug me cause I’m too damn woke”
- q: but I shouldn’t question... the medical profession
  a: and the doctor’s bedside manner made a good impression
- q: and I believe in science... as a white progressive
  a: so I said “what are the side effects”
- q: she gave me information, about the complications,
  a: like how it’s really hard to cum even from masterbation,
- q: and I really should obstain... from annhebration
  a: so I went to CVS, by the train station
- q: I started taking it the first day at a  job
  a: I was doing boat tours of the Columbia
- q: 9 hours on a boat made me feel pretty burned
  a: and I kept forgetting knots, I had already learned
- q: when you’re a tour guide you memorize facts
  a: and this drug made me stupid, although I felt relaxed
- q: and the boatman who was training us, just thought I was rude
  a: he said “isn’t 29 kind of old to have an attitude”?
- q: I contemplated, being like “I’m medicated”
  a: but I didn’t tell him, I just said “be more patient”
- q: oh but he didn’t like that, no he was quite offended
  a: but fuck that guy, it was just a paycheck
- q: so I kept on working, with determination
  a: secretly sent out a bunch of other applications
- q: and I got interviews, so many I could choose
  a: cause on Lexapro I don’t get nervous in a confrontation
- q: started a desk job with a lot more space,
  a: got some new clothes and moved to a new place
- q: started eating healthy and exercizing more
  a: stopped watching Timberlake movies and laying on floor
- q: cause this shit is magic man, it slows down your brain
  a: but just some of the negative thoughts that cause you pain
- q: because when you’re depressed you’re not insane
  a: you just need an SSRI to get you back in the game
- q: I’ve tried meditation, and breathing concentration
  a: getting so stoned, I don’t know the direction I’m facing
- q: I’ve tried accupuncture, and massage stations,
  a: moving to a small town and changing occupations
- q: but only lexapro, changed my situation
  a: it takes a while to work, so you gotta be patient

  a: it’s gonna be really hard to cum during copulation
