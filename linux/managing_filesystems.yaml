  a: group
- q: (true/false) One of the shortcomings of ext2 is that disk writes and inode table updates would get out of sync, causing complete corruption of the filesystem in the event of a power outage.
  a: true
- q: This kind of file system writes everything to a temporary file first (called the journal) and then deletes it once the inode table and the disk is updated.
  a: journaling
- q: In the event of a power outage or fatal crash, the system will read through the (blank) looking for uncomitted data.
  a: journal
- q: This type of journaling journals both the inode table and file data and is considered slower.
  a: data mode
- q: This type of journaling journals only the inode number and not the file.

  a: ReiserFS

  a: zfs
- q: What COW filesystem was developed by Oracle in 2007, also called b-tree filesystem?
  a: btrfs
- q: What command is used to help organize partitions on any storage device installed on the system?
  a: fdisk
- q: (true/false) primary partitions can be formatted with a filesystem directly.
  a: true
- q: (true/false) extended partitions can only contain other primary partitions.
  a: true
- q: What is the maximum number of partitions on a device without using extended partitions?
  a: 4
- q: Before you can store data on a partition you have to format it with a...
  a: filesystem
- q: What is the command to make an ext4 filesystem?
  a: mkfs.ext4
- q: (true/false) you can use the type command to check if a filesystem utility is installed, like type mkfs.ext4
  a: true
- q: What command is used to check and repair most file system types?
  a: fsck
- q: What type of filesystem doesn't necessarily need the fsck command? (acronym)
  a: COW
- q: What file does fsck use to determine the filesystem on a storage device that has been mounted normally?
  a: /etc/fstab
- q: (true/false) you can run fsck on a mounted filesystem.
  a: false
- q: What is a useful way to run a fsck on your bootup drive? (hint: it's a removable media)
  a: LiveCD
- q: What software package (abbreviated LVM) allows you to dynamically add more space to an existing filesystem by just adding a partition from another hard drive?
  a: logical volume manager
- q: What are hard drives called in the LVM world? (abbreviated: PV)
  a: physical volumes
- q: Each physical volume maps to a specific physical (blank) created on a hard drive.
  a: partition
- q: Multiple PV elements are pooled together to create a... (abbreviated: VG)
  a: volume group
- q: (true/false) LVM treats volume groups like a physical hard drive but in reality it could be multiple drives spread across the system.
  a: true
- q: What layer of LVM does linux treat just like a physical hard drive? (abbreviated: LV)
  a: logical volume
- q: (true/false) You can format a logical volume with only specific filesystems.
  a: false

- q: lvm1 can create snapshots but, in contrast to lvm2, they are...
  a: read only
- q: (true/false) lvm2 allows you to create a read-write snapshot of an active logical volume.
  a: true
- q: What feature of lvm2 can improve read/write performance by spreading blocks across multiple drives, thus allowing read/writes of different blocks to happen simultaneously?
  a: striping
- q: (true/false) lvm striping is not as fault tolerant as RAID striping.
