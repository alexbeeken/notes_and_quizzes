- q: What is the name of the original linux filesystem? (long version)
  a: extended filesystem
- q: What is the name of the original linux filesystem? (short version)
  a: ext
- q: What does ext use to keep track of files in the filesystem?
  a: inodes
- q: What keeps track of inodes for each physical device?
  a: inode table
- q: What is the unique number that keeps track of inodes in the inode table?
  a: inode number
- q: Ext uses this instead of having to reference files by their full filename and path.
  a: inode number
- q: One limitation of ext was that files couldn't be larger than how many GBs?
  a: 2
- q: ext2 adds the created, modified and (blank) time values.
  a: last accessed
- q: ext2 increased the maximum file size to how many TB?
  a: 2
- q: In later versions of ext2 the maximum file size increased to how many TB?
  a: 32
- q: A weakness of ext was that it would scatter block locations across the device, a problem called...
  a: fragmentation
- q: ext2 overcomes fragmentation by allocating disk blocks in a...
  a: group
- q: (true/false) One of the shortcomings of ext2 is that disk writes and inode table updates would get out of sync, causing complete corruption of the filesystem in the event of a power outage.
  a: true
- q: This kind of file system writes everything to a temporary file first (called the journal) and then deletes it once the inode table and the disk is updated.
  a: journaling
- q: In the event of a power outage or fatal crash, the system will read through the (blank) looking for uncomitted data.
  a: journal
- q: This type of journaling journals both the inode table and file data and is considered slower.
  a: data mode
- q: This type of journaling journals only the inode number and not the file.
  a: (NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED)
