The size of a bucket is theoretically infinite.

Glacier is for long term data storage, archiving. Not as easy to access as S3.

You can setup a rule to migrate old data to Glacier from S3.

Elastic Block Store = fast, made for ec2 (like a hard drive)

Elastic File System = network attached storage, allows multiple servers to access one data source 

Storage Gateway = low latency performance by caching most frequent and storing

Snowball = used to migrate data from on premise environments to the cloud

We can create a VPC inside the AWS cloud. (Virtual Private Cloud), impenetrable fortress against attack.

We can attach EBS to servers within a VPC to bolster their storage.

Using an EFS mount target you can mount storage to multiple servers.

Nothing gets into the VPS, without coming through the VPC endpoint.

AWS Storage Gateway orchestrates syncing between on site and cloud databases.

It stores copy of popular content on site. It will store all the data in an amazon s3 bucket for you.
