# Notes and Quizzes

## Required Software

I was running ruby 2.2.2 when making this but I'm pretty sure this will be compatible with most versions of ruby.

## Usage

To start the script run this in the project directory:
```
ruby questions.rb
```

You'll see a menu come up and you select the number that corresponds to the quiz you want to take.

After the quiz is over you'll have a second chance at any you missed and the final score will include those corrections.

Some of these are impossible because you will never guess the format of the answer from the question! Oh no!!!! It's best to just use these for practice and not for assessing your actual coding ability.
